# Task List Application

Project by Felipe Conde: Task List Application

I am pleased to present a personal project I developed, a task list application that showcases my skills and knowledge in software development.

This application was built using a set of modern technologies, including:

- Node.js: I utilized Node.js as the server-side runtime environment for the application. It provides an efficient and scalable platform for backend development.

- MongoDB: For data storage, I employed MongoDB, a highly flexible and scalable NoSQL database. This allows for efficient management of tasks and their associated information.

- GraphQL: I implemented GraphQL to facilitate communication between the server and the client. This technology offers an abstraction layer that enables more efficient and flexible interaction with data.

- React: To create the user interface, I utilized React, a widely recognized JavaScript framework known for its flexibility and efficiency in building interactive and responsive interfaces.

This project demonstrates my ability to develop a complete application, from server configuration to the creation of a modern and intuitive user interface.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
